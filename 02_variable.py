# Exercise: Python Variables
# Create a variable called break and assign it a value 5. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see.

# Create two variables. One to store your birth year and another one to store current year. Now calculate your age using these two variables

# Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and then print your full name using these variables

# Answer which of these are invalid variable names: _nation 1record record1 record_one record-one record^one continue





# SOLUTION:

# break = 5

my_year = 2004
current_year = 2024

my_age = current_year - my_year
print(my_age)

fname , mname , lname = "sahil " , "ajitbhai ","gohil"

print(fname+mname+lname)
